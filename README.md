# Mental Health Chatbot

Welcome to my AI-powered chatbot. This chatbot is designed to support mental well-being. It uses Google's Gemini API to generate thoughtful, conversational responses. If there‚Äôs no internet don't you worry because I created a fallback which falls back to pre-written supportive messages. So whether the user have internet or not this ensures that they never feel alone.
